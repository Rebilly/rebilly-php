# Rebilly SDK for PHP

[![Latest Version on Packagist][ico-version]][link-packagist] 
[![Software License][ico-license]](LICENSE) 
[![Total Downloads][ico-downloads]][link-downloads] 

The **Rebilly SDK for PHP** makes it easy for developers to access
[Rebilly REST APIs][link-api-doc] in their PHP code.

## Requirements

* PHP 8.0+.
* CURL (verify peer requires a root certificate authority -- if you have not configured php curl to use one, and your system libs aren't linked to one, you may need to do a [manual configuration](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17478283/paypal-access-ssl-certificate-unable-to-get-local-issuer-certificate/19149687#19149687) to use the appropriate certificate authority)

## Installation

Using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) is the recommended way to install the Rebilly SDK for PHP.
To get started, you need run the Composer commands (assume you're in the project's root directory).

- Install the latest stable version of the SDK:

```bash
composer require rebilly/client-php
```

_You can find out more on how to install Composer, configure autoloading,
and other best-practices for defining dependencies at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/)._

## Supported Versions

The previous version of the SDK can be outdated and won't provide all (or the correct) specifications to communicate with the REST APIs. Only the latest version is constantly supported.

| Version                | Supported                | Documentation                         |

## Quick Examples

Create a Rebilly Client

```php
use Rebilly\Sdk\Client;
use Rebilly\Sdk\CoreService;

// Instantiate Rebilly client.
$client = new Client([
    'base_uri' => Client::SANDBOX_HOST,
    'organizationId' => '{organizationId}',
    'apiKey' => '{secretKey}',
]);
$coreService = new CoreService(client: $client);
```

Create a Customer

```php
use Rebilly\Sdk\Exception\DataValidationException;
use Rebilly\Sdk\Model\ContactObject;
use Rebilly\Sdk\Model\Customer;

$customer = Customer::from([])
    ->setWebsiteId('{websiteId}')
    ->setPrimaryAddress(
        ContactObject::from([])
            ->setFirstName('John')
            ->setLastName('Doe'),
    );

try {
  $customer = $coreService->customers()->create($form);
} catch (DataValidationException $e) {
  var_dump($e->getValidationErrors());
}
```

## Migration from SDK v2.x to v3.x

This new major version brings several new helper classes to communicate with Rebilly REST APIs and some incompatibilities that should be tested before switching SDK versions.

- Now, a service class can be explicitly created to make the API calls instead of using only the `Client`. The service is a helper class that encapsulates the API calls for a specific context. It means that `CoreService` is responsible for the API calls related to the [core API][link-api-doc], `UsersService` for the [users API][link-api-doc-user], and `ReportsService` for the [reports API][link-api-doc-reports]. `CombinedService` can be used to make calls to any of the contexts.

- To simplify the migration from the previous version, the `Client` object can be used to make calls to any API context directly. For example, instead of instantiating a service class, one can use:
  ```php
  $client->customers()->create($form);
  ```

- The namespace changed from `Rebilly\Entities` to `Rebilly\Sdk\Model`. Now, the `src` is `Rebilly\Sdk`.

- The classes are now generated by an automated process that is triggered every time a new version of the [API definitions][link-api-defs] is released. It means more frequency on the SDK updates, keeping it synced with the REST APIs.
